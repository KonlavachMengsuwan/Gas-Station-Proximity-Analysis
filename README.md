# Gas-Station-Proximity-Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a spatial analysis that involves finding the nearest gas station to a randomly generated point within a given study area. The analysis leverages GeoPandas, Shapely, and NetworkX libraries to handle geospatial data and perform network analysis.

## Objectives
1. **Random Point Generation:** Create a random point on a randomly selected road segment within the study area.
2. **Gas Station Proximity Analysis:** Determine the shortest path from the random point to all gas stations and identify the nearest one.
3. **Visualization:** Plot the study area, roads, gas stations, random point, and the route to the nearest gas station.

## Data
The analysis uses the following GeoJSON files:
- `Gas_Stations.geojson`: Contains the locations of gas stations.
- `Study_Area.geojson`: Defines the boundary of the study area.
- `OSM_Roads_StudyArea.geojson`: Contains the OpenStreetMap roads within the study area.

## Methodology

### Random Point Generation
A random point is generated on a randomly selected road segment using the following code:
```python
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Point
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_random_point_on_road(roads_gdf):
    random_road = roads_gdf.sample(1).iloc[0]['geometry']
    random_point_on_road = random_road.interpolate(random.random(), normalized=True)
    return Point(random_point_on_road)
```python

### Network Analysis
The road network is constructed using NetworkX, and the shortest path between the random point and each gas station is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm. The nearest gas station is then identified.

#### Building the Network Graph
```python
import networkx as nx
from shapely.geometry import LineString

# Function to convert multi-line geometries into individual line segments
def add_edges_from_linestring(graph, linestring, weight):
    for i in range(len(linestring.coords) - 1):
        graph.add_edge(linestring.coords[i], linestring.coords[i + 1], weight=weight)

# Function to find the nearest node in the graph for a given point
def nearest_node(graph, point):
    return min(graph.nodes, key=lambda node: point.distance(Point(node)))

# Creating a new graph
G = nx.Graph()
for _, row in osm_roads_gdf.iterrows():
    if row.geometry.geom_type == 'MultiLineString':
        for line in row.geometry.geoms:
            add_edges_from_linestring(G, line, weight=line.length)
    else:
        add_edges_from_linestring(G, row.geometry, weight=row.geometry.length)
```

#### Calculating Shortest Paths
```python
# Function to calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
def shortest_path_to_gas_station(graph, source_node, target_node):
    return nx.shortest_path_length(graph, source=source_node, target=target_node, weight='weight')

# Finding the nearest node for the random point
random_point_node = nearest_node(G, random_point)

# Finding the nearest nodes for each gas station
gas_stations_gdf['nearest_node'] = gas_stations_gdf['geometry'].apply(lambda x: nearest_node(G, x))

# Adding the random point as a node in the graph
G.add_node(random_point_node)

# Adding an edge from the random point to the nearest node on the road
nearest_road_node = nearest_node(G, Point(random_point_node))
G.add_edge(random_point_node, nearest_road_node, weight=Point(random_point_node).distance(Point(nearest_road_node)))

# Calculate the shortest path for each gas station
gas_stations_gdf['distance_to_random_point'] = gas_stations_gdf['nearest_node'].apply(
    lambda x: shortest_path_to_gas_station(G, random_point_node, x))

# Identify the nearest gas station
nearest_gas_station = gas_stations_gdf.loc[gas_stations_gdf['distance_to_random_point'].idxmin()]

# Create a GeoDataFrame for the route to the nearest gas station
route_to_nearest_gas_station = nx.shortest_path(G, source=random_point_node, target=nearest_gas_station['nearest_node'], weight='weight')
route_line = LineString(route_to_nearest_gas_station)
route_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[route_line], crs=osm_roads_gdf.crs)
```

### Visualization
The final visualization includes the study area boundary, OSM roads, gas stations, random point, and the route to the nearest gas station.
```python
# Plotting the OSM roads (in light gray)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
osm_roads_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='#B0B0B0', linewidth=0.5)

# Plotting the study area boundary (in light blue)
study_area_gdf.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color='#ADD8E6', linewidth=2)

# Plotting the gas stations (in light red)
gas_stations_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='#FFA07A', markersize=50, zorder=2)

# Plotting the random point (in Red)
random_point_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='#D82C08', markersize=100, zorder=3)

# Plotting the route to the nearest gas station (in Green)
route_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='#32CD32', linewidth=2, zorder=4)

# Setting the axis to be equal
ax.set_aspect('equal')

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

### Results
The analysis identifies the nearest gas station and visualizes the route, providing insights into the spatial relationships between the random point and nearby gas stations.
